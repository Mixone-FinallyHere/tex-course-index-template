## SANS indexes and sources

In this folder, you will find for some SANS courses:

1. The index generated as a PDF.
2. Its source `.idx` file.

In order to use it, clone the `src` folder of this repository and take the corresponding `.idx` (e.g. `sec588.idx`) you want to edit and overwrite it as `main.idx` in the cloned template (cfr its [structure](https://github.com/dhondta/tex-course-index-template#structure)). Then, proceed as described in the [main README](https://github.com/dhondta/tex-course-index-template#compilation) for further steps.
